# Hello Development
This document will walk you through the steps required to getset up with all of the basic tools that will be used throughout each of the "lessons" within this repo. 

***NOTE:*** *There are many different tools used by developers and they all have their own advantages and disadvantages. The setup provided in this document is meant to be a starting point that individuals learning to program can use throughout their learning process. This is not meant to serve as an exhaustive list of all tools that are availiable or meant to be an example of the "ideal environment setup" it simply is a setup to get individuals up and running.*

## Getting the tools you need:

### Iterm:

### Python
Python is the language that will be used through out the "lessons" includeed in this repo. 

1. open iterm and navigate to your root directory

2. check to see if python is installed already (we will be using python 3) it ias possible that is is already installed on your sytem. This can be checked by running the following command: ```python3 -v```

3. If python is already installed you are finished other wise move on to step 4.

4. run the command ```brew install python3``` this should get python installed for you.
